Rustacean :crab: here!<br/>
I want to use Rust everywhere if I could (I couldn't).<br/>
That's why, I have a lot of side projects and pull requests related to Rust.

Also, I am a Reason-able 🐫 man, cause Rust isn't for everything.
Both are heavily influenced with functional paradigm which feels cleaner and bugless, but practical enough.

I use the strangest set of softwares which forces me to learn a lot: NixOS ❄️ and Nushell.
And BTW, I used Arch Linux for a long time.
